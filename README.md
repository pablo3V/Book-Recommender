#  BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

This is a python program to get book recommendations based on user feedback.



Note: Instead of using the files tags and book_tags, I did web scrapping to get the genres of the books. Although there is more information in the original files, I think it is enough with having 7 genres of each book and we avoid having many many tags which are duplicated or even that are irrelevant.
